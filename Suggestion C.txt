Creating a new website for Sadik International School requires a structured approach to maintain and improve its search engine ranking and traffic. Simply embedding SEO after the fact is not enough; you must integrate it throughout the planning, building, and launch phases. 
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to successfully transition to the new site while preserving or enhancing its SEO.
Phase 1: Planning and auditing the old site
The current website contains valuable SEO signals that should be identified and carried over.
Conduct a full SEO audit of the old site: Use tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to collect data on the following:
Top-performing pages and the keywords they rank for.
Total organic traffic and traffic sources.
Top landing pages.
Metadata (page titles and meta descriptions).
All URLs, especially high-traffic ones.
The complete backlink profile.nz
Site structure and internal linking.
Website speed and mobile-friendliness.
Establish a redirect map: For every URL that is changing or being removed, create a 301 (permanent) redirect that points to the most relevant new page. This is the single most important step to preserve SEO value.
Back up all current content: Don't discard any old content. Back up the text, images, and other assets. You may need them to rewrite content for the new site or to recover from a data loss. 
Phase 2: Building the new website
As you create the new site, you must build the SEO directly into the new architecture.
Implement a clean and mobile-first design: The new site should be fully responsive and load quickly on all devices. A fast, user-friendly experience is a key ranking factor. Use tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights to test your progress.
Use an SEO-friendly CMS: Choose a platform like WordPress with a robust SEO plugin (such as Yoast SEO or Rank Math) that can help manage many SEO elements for you automatically.
Structure the site for SEO and usability:
Create a logical and user-friendly site architecture with clear navigation.
Keep high-traffic pages as close to the homepage as possible (in as few clicks as possible).
Use SEO-friendly permalinks that are simple, descriptive, and include keywords.
Create and optimize your content:
Recreate and refresh the best-performing pages you identified in your audit.
Write unique and engaging content for each page that matches the user's search intent.
Integrate keywords naturally into page titles, meta descriptions, headers (H1, H2), and body text.
Address all technical SEO aspects:
Use a secure HTTPS connection.
Optimize all images with descriptive filenames, proper alt text, and file compression.
Create and submit a new XML sitemap to Google Search Console.
Ensure canonical tags are used to prevent duplicate content issues. 
Phase 3: Launch and post-launch management
The work isn't done once the site goes live. The launch must be carefully managed to avoid traffic loss.
Stage the site for testing: Before going live, use a staging environment (a temporary, non-indexed URL) to test everything. Block search engines from indexing this version using a robots.txt file or meta tags.
Prepare for launch:
Perform a final crawl to ensure no broken links exist.
Double-check that the robots.txt file is not blocking important pages.
Import all 301 redirects.
Launch the site and notify Google:
Publish the new site and test the 301 redirects to ensure they work correctly.
In Google Search Console, use the "Change of Address" tool if the domain name is changing.
Request indexing of the most important new pages.
Monitor post-launch performance:
Regularly check Google Analytics and Google Search Console for any drops in traffic, crawl errors, or indexing issues.
Monitor keyword rankings to ensure they have stabilized.
Use tools to check your site speed and address any performance issues.
Focus on continuous SEO:
SEO is an ongoing process. Continue to update existing content, publish new content, and strengthen your backlink profile over time.
Be patient. A temporary drop in traffic can occur for a few weeks or months as search engines re-index the new site. Consistent effort will help recover and surpass previous performance.
